# Welcome to Mac AI Pilot

> **The Missing Manual for Local AI on Apple Silicon**

Running AI models locally on your Mac has never been easier—or more powerful. Whether you're a creative professional exploring AI art generation or a developer building intelligent applications, your Apple Silicon Mac is a remarkably capable AI workstation.

## Why Local AI?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔒 **Privacy** | Your data never leaves your machine |
| ⚡ **Speed** | No network latency, instant responses |
| 💰 **Cost** | No API fees or subscriptions |
| 🌐 **Offline** | Works without internet connection |

## What Makes Apple Silicon Special?

Apple's M1/M2/M3 chips feature **Unified Memory Architecture (UMA)**, which means the same high-bandwidth memory is shared between CPU and GPU. This is a game-changer for AI inference:

:::tip Key Advantage
Unlike traditional PCs where you need expensive dedicated GPUs with separate VRAM, your Mac's unified memory can be fully utilized for running large language models.

## Hardware Requirements

| Mac Model | RAM | Best For |
|-----------|-----|----------|
| M1/M2/M3 | 8GB | Small models (7B parameters) |
| M1/M2/M3 Pro | 18-36GB | Medium models (13-30B) |
| M1/M2/M3 Max | 64-128GB | Large models (70B+) |
| M1/M2 Ultra | 128GB+ | Massive models (120B+) |

:::warning System Memory
macOS reserves 2-6GB of memory for system processes. Your actual available memory for AI models will be less than your total RAM.
