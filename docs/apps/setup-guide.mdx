# The Golden Path: Preparing Your Mac for AI

Before diving into AI applications, let's ensure your Mac is properly configured. This guide will walk you through the essential setup steps.

## Prerequisites

- A Mac with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, or M3 chip)
- macOS Ventura (13.0) or later
- At least 8GB of unified memory (16GB+ recommended)

## Step 1: Install Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is the package manager for macOS. It's essential for installing developer tools and AI software.

Open **Terminal** (press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter) and paste:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After installation, follow the on-screen instructions to add Homebrew to your PATH.

:::tip Verification
Run `brew --version` to confirm installation. You should see a version number like `Homebrew 4.x.x`.
:::

## Step 2: Install Python 3.10

:::warning Python Version Warning
**Use Python 3.10 or 3.11, NOT 3.12+**

Many AI libraries (especially those using PyTorch or TensorFlow) have compatibility issues with Python 3.12+. Stick with 3.10 for the smoothest experience.
:::

Install Python 3.10 via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install python@3.10
```

Set it as your default Python (optional):

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
python3.10 --version
# Should output: Python 3.10.x
```

## Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

Always use virtual environments to avoid dependency conflicts:

```bash
# Create a directory for AI projects
mkdir -p ~/AI-Projects
cd ~/AI-Projects

# Create a virtual environment
python3.10 -m venv ai-env

# Activate it
source ai-env/bin/activate
```

:::tip Pro Tip
Add an alias to your `~/.zshrc` for quick activation:
```bash
echo 'alias aienv="source ~/AI-Projects/ai-env/bin/activate"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
Now just type `aienv` to activate your AI environment!
:::

## Step 4: Install Essential Tools

With your virtual environment activated:

```bash
# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install common AI libraries (Apple Silicon optimized)
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install transformers accelerate
pip install numpy pandas
```

## Step 5: Verify Metal Support

Apple's **Metal** framework enables GPU acceleration on Mac. Verify it's working:

```python
import torch
print(f"MPS available: {torch.backends.mps.is_available()}")
print(f"MPS built: {torch.backends.mps.is_built()}")
```

Both should return `True`.

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: brew"
Run the following and restart Terminal:
```bash
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

### Python conflicts
If you have multiple Python versions, always use explicit version commands:
```bash
python3.10 -m pip install <package>
```

### Xcode Command Line Tools
Some packages require Apple's developer tools:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
