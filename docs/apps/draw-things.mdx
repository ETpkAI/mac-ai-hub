## Why Draw Things?

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| 🍎 **Native Mac App** | Built specifically for macOS, not a web wrapper |
| 🔒 **100% Local** | No internet required, complete privacy |
| ⚡ **Metal Optimized** | Uses Apple GPU acceleration for fast generation |
| 🆓 **Free** | No subscription, no API costs |
| 📱 **iPad Support** | Same app works on iPad with M-series chips |

:::tip No Command Line Required!
Unlike many AI tools, Draw Things has a beautiful graphical interface. Perfect for creators who want to focus on art, not terminal commands.

## Installation

### Method 1: App Store (Recommended)

1. Open the **App Store** on your Mac
2. Search for "Draw Things"
3. Click **Get** to download

### Method 2: Direct Download

Visit [drawthings.ai](https://drawthings.ai) to download directly.

## First-Time Setup

### 1. Download a Model

When you first open Draw Things, you'll need to download a model:

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon) → **Models**
2. Recommended starter model: **Stable Diffusion XL Base**
3. Click **Download** and wait for it to complete

:::warning Storage Space
SDXL models are ~6GB. Ensure you have sufficient disk space before downloading.

### 2. Generate Your First Image

1. Type a prompt in the text box, e.g.:
   ```
   A majestic snow leopard on a mountain peak, 
   golden hour lighting, photorealistic, 8K
   ```

2. Click **Generate**

3. Wait 30-60 seconds (first generation is slower due to model loading)

## Recommended Settings for Apple Silicon

### For 8GB Macs (M1/M2/M3 Base)

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Model | SD 1.5 or SDXL (with memory optimization) |
| Image Size | 512×512 or 768×768 |
| Steps | 20-25 |
| Guidance | 7.0 |

### For 16GB+ Macs (Pro/Max)

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Model | SDXL, SD 3, or custom fine-tunes |
| Image Size | 1024×1024 or higher |
| Steps | 25-30 |
| Guidance | 7.5 |

## Tips for Better Results

### Prompt Engineering

```
✅ Good: "Portrait of a cyberpunk samurai, neon city background, 
         rain reflections, cinematic lighting, highly detailed"

❌ Bad:  "samurai in city"
```

### Negative Prompts
Add these to avoid common issues:
```
blurry, low quality, distorted, ugly, 
deformed hands, extra fingers, watermark
```

### Seed Consistency
Lock the seed number to reproduce similar results with prompt variations.

## Troubleshooting

### "Out of memory" errors
- Reduce image size
- Close other applications
- Enable "Low Memory Mode" in settings

### Slow generation
- First generation loads the model (normal to be slow)
- Check Activity Monitor for memory pressure
- Restart the app to clear cache

### Model not loading
- Verify download completed
- Check **~/Library/Application Support/Draw Things/** for corrupted files

## Model Recommendations

| Model | Best For | VRAM Needed |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| SD 1.5 | General, fast | 4GB |
| SDXL | High quality, detailed | 8GB |
| SD 3 | Latest generation | 12GB+ |
| Flux | Photorealistic | 12GB+ |
