# Pinokio: One-Click AI App Installer

**Pinokio** is a revolutionary tool that lets you install and run complex AI applications with a single click. No command line, no dependency management, no headaches.

## What is Pinokio?

Think of Pinokio as an "App Store for AI". It automates:
- Installing Python environments
- Managing dependencies
- Downloading models
- Configuring settings


:::tip Perfect for Beginners
Pinokio abstracts away all the technical complexity. Install ComfyUI, Stable Diffusion WebUI, or Ollama without touching the terminal.
:::

## Installation

### Step 1: Download Pinokio

Visit [pinokio.computer](https://pinokio.computer) and download the macOS version.

### Step 2: Bypass macOS Security Warning

When you first open Pinokio, macOS may block it because it's from an "unidentified developer".

:::warning Required Step
Apple's Gatekeeper blocks apps from unknown developers. You **must** follow these steps to run Pinokio.
:::

**Option A: System Preferences**
1. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down to **Security**
3. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the Pinokio warning

**Option B: Terminal Command (if Option A doesn't work)**

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Pinokio.app
```

This removes all quarantine attributes from the app.

:::tip What does `xattr -cr` do?
- `xattr` = extended attributes command
- `-c` = clear all attributes
- `-r` = recursive (affects all files in the app bundle)

This is safe for apps you trust. Apple's Gatekeeper adds these attributes to downloaded apps.
:::

### Step 3: First Launch

1. Open Pinokio
2. Wait for initial setup (downloads Node.js runtime)
3. Browse the app library

## Recommended Apps to Install

### For Creators (No Coding Required)

| App | Description | RAM Needed |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| **ComfyUI** | Node-based image generation | 8GB+ |
| **Stable Diffusion WebUI** | Classic SD interface | 8GB+ |
| **Fooocus** | Simplified SD experience | 8GB+ |

### For Developers

| App | Description | RAM Needed |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| **Ollama** | Run LLMs locally | 8GB+ |
| **Text Generation WebUI** | Chat with LLMs | 16GB+ |
| **Open WebUI** | Beautiful Ollama frontend | 8GB+ |

## Installing an App

1. Open Pinokio
2. Click **Discover** in the sidebar
3. Find your desired app (e.g., "ComfyUI")
4. Click **Download**
5. Wait for dependencies to install
6. Click **Start** when complete

## Managing Installed Apps

### Starting/Stopping Apps
Click the app in your library → **Start** or **Stop**

### Updating Apps
Click the app → **Update** (if available)

### Viewing Logs
Click the app → **Terminal** to see output

### Uninstalling
Click the app → **Settings** → **Delete**

## Troubleshooting

### "App requires Rosetta"
Some apps need Rosetta 2 for Intel compatibility:
```bash
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

### Installation stuck
1. Check Terminal output for errors
2. Try **Stop** then **Start** again
3. Delete and reinstall the app

### "Port already in use"
Another app is using the same port. Either:
- Stop the conflicting app
- Change the port in the app's settings

### Slow downloads
Model downloads can be large (5-20GB). Be patient and ensure stable internet.

## Best Practices

### Storage Management
Pinokio apps and models can consume significant disk space:
- Check **Settings** → **Storage** to see usage
- Delete unused models periodically
- Consider an external SSD for model storage

### Memory Optimization
When running multiple apps:
- Stop apps you're not using
- Monitor with Activity Monitor
- Restart Pinokio if memory pressure is high

### Regular Updates
Keep apps updated for:
- Performance improvements
- Security patches
- New features
